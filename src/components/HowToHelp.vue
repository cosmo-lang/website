    Cosmo is open-source, so you can go in and look at and modify the code for yourself. This means that if you find a bug or want a feature, you can just do it yourself! Of course this doesn't mean I won't, but it is always helpful to have people contributing. If you contribute you will get a Contributor role in my Discord server, as well as your name (with your GitHub linked) and what you contributed to Cosmo on it's README. If you want to learn how you can create things for Cosmo, we have a small section of documentation <a class="nice-hl" href="https://github.com/cosmo-lang/cosmo/wiki/Contributing">here</a> describing how. You can find Cosmo's repository on the <router-link class="nice-hl" to="/">Home</router-link> page.

  <ListBlock title="Updates, questions, discussions, and more">
    If you're unsure about anything, need to know where to find something, are interested in what's changing with Cosmo, want to talk about Cosmo, want to share your Cosmo projects, or anything else of that nature, <a class="nice-hl" href="https://discord.gg/WHyHh39dwh">our Discord server</a> is the place to do it. We also have a bot that you can execute Cosmo code with, no installation necessary.
